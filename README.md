# Drug-Consumption

## Project Objective
This project analyzes drug consumption patterns using demographic, behavioral, and personality-trait data to uncover correlations and risk indicators, leveraging Tableau dashboards to explore how factors like age, gender, emotionality, impulsiveness, and social behavior influence the frequency of soft, hard, and recreational drug use, ultimately providing insights into consumption trends, addiction risks, and personality-substance use relationships.
