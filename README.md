# Drug-Consumption

## Project Objective
This project analyzes drug consumption patterns using demographic, behavioral, and personality-trait data to uncover correlations and risk indicators, leveraging Tableau dashboards to explore how factors like age, gender, emotionality, impulsiveness, and social behavior influence the frequency of soft, hard, and recreational drug use, ultimately providing insights into consumption trends, addiction risks, and personality-substance use relationships.

## Dataset Used

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Overall Drug Usage Score – Measures the combined frequency and intensity of consumption across all substances.
2. Soft Drug Use Index – Tracks usage levels of substances like cannabis, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.
3. Hard Drug Use Index – Quantifies consumption of high-risk substances such as heroin, crack, cocaine, LSD, and meth.
4. Recreational Drug Frequency – Measures the frequency of leisure-based drug use (e.g., ecstasy, mushrooms, ketamine).
5. Addiction Risk Score – Predicts an individual's likelihood of developing dependency based on consumption patterns and behavior traits.
6. Impulsivity & Self-Control Scores – Evaluates how behavioral factors influence drug-use tendencies.
7. Emotionality Score – Assesses the correlation between emotional stability and substance use.
8. Personality Influence Index – Measures how personality traits (Big Five: OCEAN) relate to drug consumption.
9. Demographic Drug Use Comparison – Tracks drug usage variations across age groups, gender, and country.
10. High-Risk User Identification Rate – Indicates the proportion of individuals falling into high-risk consumption categories.

## Process
1. **Data Preparation (Excel Source):** Imported the raw Excel dataset containing demographic attributes, personality scores, drug labels, and consumption frequencies. Cleaned missing values, standardized column names, and validated data types for accurate analysis.
2. **Data Structuring & Feature Categorization:** Organized variables into logical groups—soft drugs, hard drugs, recreational drugs, demographics, personality traits (OCEAN), and behavioral indicators. Created derived metrics such as Overall Drug Usage, Addiction Risk Score, and Frequency Indexes.
3. **Dashboard Development (Tableau):** Connected the cleaned Excel file to Tableau, designed interactive dashboards, and applied filters for age, gender, drug type, and personality traits. Built visual KPIs, trend analysis, and comparison charts to highlight consumption patterns.
4. **Insights & Validation:** Interpreted dashboard outputs to identify correlations and high-risk behavior patterns. Verified findings through cross-variable comparisons and ensured visual accuracy and usability for decision-making.
